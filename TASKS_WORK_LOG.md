# Tasks Work Log

Use this file as the active queue and progress ledger for rewrite slices.

## Usage

1. Add all new work to **Queue** with the next `Q-XXX` ID.
2. Move an item to **In Progress** when execution starts.
3. Move blocked work to **Blocked** with a concrete blocker in `Notes`.
4. Move completed work to **Done** and convert the ID to `D-XXX`.

## Queue

| ID | Priority | Task | Owner | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q-219 | P1 | Add assignment-source filters on human task session-linked projections so session detail can surface just recommended/manual/auto-preselected packet subsets without client-side filtering | codex | queued | Task-scoped history can now isolate ownership sources and queue views can open those slices directly, but session detail still returns one combined `human_tasks` array without a source-filtered companion view |

## Done

| ID | Priority | Task | Owner | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-218 | P1 | Add assignment-source filters on human task assignment-history and session projections so operator tooling can isolate recommended/manual/auto-preselected transitions without manual event scans | codex | done | `GET /v1/human/tasks/{human_task_id}/assignment-history` now accepts `assignment_source`, and approved smoke coverage proves recommended ownership transitions can be isolated directly from the task-scoped event chain |
| D-217 | P1 | Add assignment-source filters on human task queue list/backlog views so operators can open the same pending slice exposed by the summary endpoint without client-side filtering | codex | done | Human task list, backlog, and mine queue endpoints now accept `assignment_source`, and approved smoke coverage proves manual and planner `auto_preselected` pending slices can be opened directly after the summary reveals them |
| D-216 | P1 | Add assignment-source filters on human task priority summaries so operator dashboards can separate auto-preselected, manual-assigned, and ownerless load before claim | codex | done | `GET /v1/human/tasks/priority-summary` now accepts `assignment_source`, and approved smoke coverage proves pending manual and planner `auto_preselected` queues can be counted separately before reviewers open the backlog |
| D-215 | P1 | Add role-match-aware priority summaries for operator backlog routing so reviewers can see candidate urgent/high load before claiming work | codex | done | `GET /v1/human/tasks/priority-summary` now accepts `operator_id`, and approved smoke coverage proves pre-claim reviewer-routing summaries can count only packets that exactly match one operator profile’s role, rubric-derived skill tags, and trust tier |
| D-214 | P1 | Add operator-specific priority summaries so `mine` queues can expose urgent/high/normal load after reviewer-assignment filters | codex | done | `GET /v1/human/tasks/priority-summary` now accepts `assigned_operator_id`, and approved smoke coverage proves assigned reviewer queues can inspect their own priority-band totals without fetching the full packet list |
| D-213 | P1 | Add priority summary counts on operator human-task queues so reviewers can see urgent/high/normal load before applying queue filters | codex | done | Added `GET /v1/human/tasks/priority-summary`, backed by repository priority counts and approved smoke coverage, so operators can inspect band totals before choosing `urgent`, `urgent,high`, or full-queue views |
| D-212 | P1 | Add comma-separated priority filters on operator human-task queues so reviewers can pull urgent and high work together without client-side merging | codex | done | Human task list/backlog/unassigned/mine endpoints now accept comma-separated `priority` filters such as `urgent,high`, and approved smoke coverage proves combined priority-band queues stay ordered correctly without client-side union logic |
| D-211 | P1 | Add priority filter support on operator human-task queues so reviewers can isolate urgent or high work before applying sort order | codex | done | Human task list/backlog/unassigned/mine endpoints now accept exact `priority` filters, and approved smoke coverage proves operators can isolate specific priority bands before applying created-order queue views |
| D-210 | P1 | Add priority-desc-created-asc sort mode for operator queues so urgent human work floats first while preserving FIFO within each priority band | codex | done | Human task list/backlog/unassigned/mine endpoints now accept `sort=priority_desc_created_asc`, and approved smoke coverage proves urgent/high packets sort ahead of normal work while each priority band stays oldest-created-first |
| D-209 | P1 | Add explicit created-asc sort mode for operator queues so manual backlog triage can pin oldest untouched work first without relying on SLA fields | codex | done | Human task list/backlog/unassigned/mine endpoints now accept `sort=created_asc`, and approved smoke coverage proves FIFO oldest-created ordering survives assignment churn across operator queue views |
| D-208 | P1 | Add oldest-created fallback ordering for unscheduled human tasks so no-SLA backlog can still remain stable under churn-heavy sorting | codex | done | SLA-oriented human task queue sorts now fall back to oldest-created ordering for rows without `sla_due_at`, and approved smoke coverage proves unscheduled backlog stays stable even after newer reassignment churn |
| D-207 | P1 | Add combined backlog ordering that breaks SLA ties by the latest ownership churn so overdue work stays stable under heavy reassignment | codex | done | Human task list/backlog endpoints now accept `sort=sla_due_at_asc_last_transition_desc`, and approved smoke coverage proves same-SLA work orders by earliest SLA first and freshest ownership churn second |
| D-206 | P1 | Add SLA-aware sorting on human task backlog endpoints so operators can switch between freshest ownership churn and oldest due work | codex | done | Human task list/backlog endpoints now accept `sort=sla_due_at_asc`, and approved smoke coverage proves the earliest pending SLA sorts ahead of later-due work in both general list and direct backlog views |
| D-205 | P1 | Add last-transition-aware sorting on human task backlog/list endpoints so operators can order queues by the freshest ownership churn | codex | done | Human task list/backlog endpoints now accept `sort=last_transition_desc`, and approved smoke coverage proves a recently reassigned task sorts ahead of a newer but untouched pending packet |
| D-204 | P1 | Add last-transition summaries on human task backlog/session rows so operators can spot recent reassignments without expanding the full history chain | codex | done | Human task list/detail/session rows now expose compact `last_transition_*` fields derived from the latest ownership event, so operators can answer “who touched this last?” without opening the full assignment-history chain |
| D-203 | P1 | Add operator-facing filters on task assignment history so reviewers can isolate reassignments, claims, or returns without scanning the full transition list | codex | done | `GET /v1/human/tasks/{human_task_id}/assignment-history` now accepts `event_name`, `assigned_operator_id`, and `assigned_by_actor_id`, with approved smoke coverage proving reassignment-only and return-only audit views |
| D-202 | P1 | Expose human-task assignment history directly in session projections so operator UIs do not need a second fetch to audit reassignment decisions | codex | done | `/v1/rewrite/sessions/{session_id}` now includes `human_task_assignment_history`, mirroring the task-scoped ownership transition chain inline with human task packets so reassignment audit is available in a single session fetch |
| D-201 | P1 | Add assignment transition history so reassignments can be audited without overwriting earlier reviewer ownership provenance | codex | done | Added `GET /v1/human/tasks/{human_task_id}/assignment-history`, backed by filtered execution-ledger transitions, and expanded the smoke path to prove recommended assignment, later manual reassignment, claim, and return remain queryable after the packet state advances |
| D-200 | P1 | Add reviewer assignment provenance timestamps and actor IDs so ownership changes are auditable beyond the current source label | codex | done | Human task packets now persist `assigned_at` and `assigned_by_actor_id` across storage, API/session projections, and ledger events, with migration `v0_30` and approved smoke/Postgres contract coverage |
| D-199 | P1 | Add explicit assignment-source audit visibility so manual, hint-driven, and planner auto-assigned reviewer ownership are distinguishable | codex | done | Human task packets now persist `assignment_source` so session and operator projections can distinguish manual assignment, route-level recommended assignment, and planner auto-preselection after later claim and return transitions |
| D-198 | P1 | Let planner-native human-task creation auto-apply a unique exact reviewer preselection when policy allows | codex | done | Task contracts can now enable `human_review_auto_assign_if_unique`, which projects onto compiled `step_human_review` plan nodes and lets the queue runtime pre-assign a single exact reviewer match before the packet lands in the backlog |
| D-197 | P1 | Add a recommended-reviewer assignment action so human tasks can use `auto_assign_operator_id` without forcing clients to submit a manual operator choice | codex | done | `POST /v1/human/tasks/{human_task_id}/assign` now accepts an omitted `operator_id` and consumes `routing_hints_json.auto_assign_operator_id`, so a single exact reviewer match can be pre-assigned without the client echoing the same operator choice back |
| D-196 | P1 | Add backlog auto-assignment hints so specialized operator profiles can be suggested or preselected without manual backlog scanning | codex | done | Human task payloads and session-linked `human_tasks` now compute `routing_hints_json` from active operator profiles, rubric-derived skill tags, and trust-tier requirements, exposing `suggested_operator_ids`, `recommended_operator_id`, and `auto_assign_operator_id` with approved smoke and Postgres contract coverage |
| D-195 | P1 | Add operator profile and skill metadata so human-task routing can target reviewer specialization instead of only role labels | codex | done | Durable operator profiles now persist role, skill-tag, and trust-tier metadata, and backlog filtering can target a specific operator profile so only matching pending work is surfaced over the human-task plane with approved smoke and Postgres contract coverage |
| D-194 | P1 | Add planner-native human-review quality rubric and authority metadata so operator packets explain why a human is needed and how returned work should be judged | codex | done | Compiled `step_human_review` nodes and direct human task packets now persist `authority_required`, `why_human`, and `quality_rubric_json` through plan output, API/session projections, Postgres storage, and approved smoke/contract coverage |
| D-193 | P1 | Add task-contract-driven SLA/priority metadata for compiled human-review steps so planner-native review work can route with stronger operational semantics | codex | done | Planner output now projects `priority`, relative `human_review_sla_minutes`, and `human_review_desired_output_json` onto `step_human_review`, and the runtime-created human task packet consumes those values directly for reviewer routing and SLA visibility |
| D-192 | P1 | Let downstream tool steps consume returned human-review payloads so compiled review branches can modify final artifacts instead of only gating them | codex | done | The artifact-save step now reads `returned_payload_json.final_text` from its completed human-review parent step, and the smoke path proves reviewer-edited text becomes the final persisted artifact content |
| D-191 | P1 | Execute compiled `human_task` plan steps through the queue runtime so review branches pause and resume without a separate API create call | codex | done | Rewrite execution now auto-runs `step_human_review` into a linked human task packet, returns `202 awaiting_human`, and resumes the remaining queue path when the packet is returned |
| D-190 | P1 | Let the planner emit the first non-artifact workflow branch so human review becomes a compiled step kind instead of an external follow-up API call | codex | done | Task contracts can now project `step_human_review` plan nodes through `budget_policy_json.human_review_role`, with plan-step role/task/brief metadata exposed over HTTP smoke coverage and release docs while runtime auto-execution remains queued as the next slice |
| D-189 | P1 | Expand the planner beyond a single artifact-save intent so core workflows project explicit multi-step plan structure | codex | done | Planner output now emits a three-step rewrite graph (`step_input_prepare` -> `step_policy_evaluate` -> `step_artifact_save`) with dependency/input/output metadata, and approval pauses on the actual approval-gated step after non-side-effect prefix work completes |
| D-188 | P1 | Add explicit assignment state on human tasks so pre-assigned pending work is first-class in projections instead of inferred | codex | done | Added durable `assignment_state` values (`unassigned`, `assigned`, `claimed`, `returned`) across human task storage, API/session payloads, bootstrap migration `v0_26`, and smoke/Postgres contract coverage so backlog and session views expose assignment lifecycle directly |
| D-187 | P1 | Add explicit assignment-state visibility or dedicated pre-assigned backlog views so pending owner assignment is distinct from unassigned work | codex | done | Added `/v1/human/tasks/unassigned` plus `assignment_state=assigned|unassigned` backlog filters so ownerless pending work is visibly distinct from pre-assigned pending work |
| D-186 | P1 | Add explicit operator assignment semantics beyond claim-only ownership so reviewers can pre-assign packets without starting work | codex | done | Added `/v1/human/tasks/{human_task_id}/assign`, preserved pending status for pre-assigned packets, and emitted `human_task_assigned` ledger events before later claim/return transitions |
| D-185 | P1 | Add role-claim assignment flow and explicit operator backlog endpoints on top of the filtered human task queue | codex | done | Added `/v1/human/tasks/backlog` and `/v1/human/tasks/mine` views backed by the existing filtered queue so operators can pull pending and assigned work directly after claim |
| D-184 | P1 | Add operator-facing role and SLA filters to the human task queue so reviewers can work from targeted pending packets | codex | done | Human task queue listings now support `role_required`, `assigned_operator_id`, and `overdue_only` filters across HTTP and Postgres repository contract coverage |
| D-183 | P1 | Resume or advance execution from returned human task packets instead of leaving them as linked review records only | codex | done | Human task packets can now reopen a linked step into `waiting_human`, move the session to `awaiting_human`, and resume the step/session when the returned packet is posted back |
| D-182 | P1 | Introduce first-class human task packets instead of using approvals as the only human interaction primitive | codex | done | Added durable human task storage plus `/v1/human/tasks` create/list/get/claim/return routes, linked session projection rows, ledger events, migration/bootstrap wiring, and smoke/contract coverage |
| D-181 | P1 | Replace approval-required rewrite `409` responses with a first-class async acceptance contract (`202` + pending session metadata) | codex | done | Approval-required rewrites now return `202 Accepted` with `session_id`, `approval_id`, `status=awaiting_approval`, and `next_action=poll_or_subscribe`, while the existing approval resume flow remains intact |
| D-180 | P1 | Require connector binding resolution and principal-aware credential checks before `connector.dispatch` execution can queue delivery | codex | done | `connector.dispatch` now requires an enabled connector binding in the caller's principal scope before `/v1/tools/execute` can queue delivery, and foreign-principal attempts fail before side effects |
| D-179 | P1 | Add a real connector/tool handler path beyond `artifact_repository`, starting with a registry-backed `connector.dispatch` execution slice | codex | done | `connector.dispatch` now executes through `ToolExecutionService`, `POST /v1/tools/execute` exposes the shared handler path, and successful calls queue durable outbox rows with normalized `tool.v1` receipts |
| D-178 | P1 | Promote the rewrite step-handler scaffold into a reusable tool-execution service with registry-backed handlers and normalized invocation contracts | codex | done | Rewrite tool-call steps now execute through `ToolExecutionService`, the built-in `artifact_repository` handler is registry-backed, and receipts expose a normalized `tool.v1` invocation contract |
| D-177 | P1 | Replace hardcoded `artifact_repository`-only execution with a typed step-handler/tool-execution gateway | codex | done | Rewrite planning/execution now uses `step_input_prepare` and `step_artifact_save` handlers with sequential queue execution instead of a single hardcoded artifact-save step |
| D-176 | P1 | Derive principal context from auth/middleware instead of caller-supplied fields on normal user routes | codex | done | Principal-scoped connector and memory routes now derive request scope from `X-EA-Principal-ID`/`EA_DEFAULT_PRINCIPAL_ID`, reject mismatched caller-supplied principal IDs with `403 principal_scope_mismatch`, and hide foreign connector status updates |
| D-001 | P0 | Create rewrite baseline skeleton and harden container privileges | codex | done | Removed docker runtime package from app image |
| D-002 | P0 | Add execution ledger + policy gating + channel runtime core | codex | done | Memory + postgres-capable backends with fallback |
