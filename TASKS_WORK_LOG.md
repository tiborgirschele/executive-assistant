# Tasks Work Log

Use this file as the active queue and progress ledger for rewrite slices.

## Usage

1. Add all new work to **Queue** with the next `Q-XXX` ID.
2. Move an item to **In Progress** when execution starts.
3. Move blocked work to **Blocked** with a concrete blocker in `Notes`.
4. Move completed work to **Done** and convert the ID to `D-XXX`.

## Queue

| ID | Priority | Task | Owner | Status | Notes |
