# EA Work Tasks (Unattended Chain Queue)

Last updated: 2026-03-05
Owner: Codex runtime worker

## Operating Rule
- If any task below is `PENDING` or `IN_PROGRESS`, continue by executing the first such task in order.
- Do not stop on local commits; commit and immediately continue with the next task.
- Do not push from assistant runtime; operator handles pushes.
- Prefer preapproved scripts and host-only gates when escalation is not available.

## Status Legend
- `DONE`: finished and validated.
- `IN_PROGRESS`: currently being executed.
- `PENDING`: queued and ready.
- `BLOCKED`: requires external dependency/approval.
