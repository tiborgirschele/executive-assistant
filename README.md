# EA Rewrite Baseline

This repository has been reset for a clean rewrite.

Kept:
- core application scaffold in `ea/app`
- deployment baseline (`ea/Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `scripts/deploy.sh`)
- environment/config templates (`.env.example`, `config/`)

Removed:
- legacy rollout docs, milestone scripts, and historical test packs
- legacy process/task-tracking artifacts
- legacy sidecar/runtime-specific operational clutter

## Runtime Spine (Rewrite Seed)

- `app.main` exposes a FastAPI app
- `/health`, `/health/live`, `/health/ready`, `/version` provide liveness/readiness/version probes
- `/v1/rewrite/artifact` creates an artifact and an execution session
- `/v1/rewrite/artifacts/{artifact_id}` fetches persisted artifact content directly from the durable artifact store
- `/v1/rewrite/receipts/{receipt_id}` and `/v1/rewrite/run-costs/{cost_id}` expose direct execution proof records without requiring full session expansion
- `/v1/rewrite/sessions/{session_id}` exposes execution ledger detail (events, steps, queue items, receipts, artifacts, costs, human task packets, and human task assignment history)
- `/v1/human/tasks*` manages principal-scoped human review/work packets linked back to execution sessions and steps
- `/v1/human/tasks/operators*` manages principal-scoped operator profiles with role, skill-tag, and trust-tier metadata used for specialized backlog routing
- `/v1/human/tasks/backlog` and `/v1/human/tasks/mine` expose direct operator backlog views on top of the human task queue
- `/v1/human/tasks/{human_task_id}/assign` allows pre-assigning operator ownership before the task is claimed into active work, and can consume a computed `auto_assign_operator_id` when the caller omits `operator_id`
- `/v1/human/tasks/{human_task_id}/assignment-history` exposes task-scoped ownership transitions and supports filtering by transition name, assigned operator, or assigning actor without requiring callers to diff the full session event stream
- `/v1/human/tasks/unassigned` and `assignment_state=unassigned|assigned|claimed|returned` expose the difference between ownerless pending work, pre-assigned pending work, active claims, and returned packets
- human task payloads and session-linked `human_tasks` now project `routing_hints_json` with `suggested_operator_ids`, `recommended_operator_id`, and `auto_assign_operator_id` so specialized reviewers can be suggested or preselected without a separate profile-filtered backlog scan
- `/v1/observations/ingest` and `/v1/observations/recent` provide channel-agnostic observation intake
- `/v1/delivery/outbox` endpoints provide channel-agnostic queued delivery tracking
- `/v1/delivery/outbox/{delivery_id}/failed` marks retry/dead-letter transitions with error context
- `/v1/tools/registry*` manages typed tool contracts (`tool_name`, schemas, policy metadata)
- `/v1/tools/execute` runs built-in tool handlers through the shared execution plane
- `/v1/connectors/bindings*` manages external connector bindings and status transitions
- `/v1/tasks/contracts*` manages typed task contracts used by intent compilation
- `/v1/plans/compile` emits a typed plan DSL projection from task contracts
- `/v1/memory/candidates*` stages reviewable memory candidates from runtime signals
- `/v1/memory/items*` lists promoted long-term memory items with provenance
- `/v1/memory/entities*` upserts/list/gets semantic entities for people/projects/objects
- `/v1/memory/relationships*` upserts/list/gets relationship edges between entities
- `/v1/memory/commitments*` upserts/list/gets principal-scoped commitments
- `/v1/memory/authority-bindings*` upserts/list/gets principal-scoped authority bindings
- `/v1/memory/delivery-preferences*` upserts/list/gets principal-scoped delivery preferences
- `/v1/memory/follow-ups*` upserts/list/gets principal-scoped follow-up records
- `/v1/memory/deadline-windows*` upserts/list/gets principal-scoped deadline windows
- `/v1/memory/stakeholders*` upserts/list/gets principal-scoped stakeholder profiles
- `/v1/memory/decision-windows*` upserts/list/gets principal-scoped decision windows
- `/v1/memory/communication-policies*` upserts/list/gets principal-scoped communication policies
- `/v1/memory/follow-up-rules*` upserts/list/gets principal-scoped follow-up automation rules
- `/v1/memory/interruption-budgets*` upserts/list/gets principal-scoped interruption budgets
- the principal-scoped memory seed surface is explicitly covered by both `tests/smoke_runtime_api.py` and the approved host smoke path (`scripts/smoke_api.sh` via `scripts/smoke_postgres.sh`)
- principal-scoped connector and memory routes now derive their effective principal from `X-EA-Principal-ID` or `EA_DEFAULT_PRINCIPAL_ID` instead of trusting caller-supplied body/query IDs
- rewrite execution now records `plan_compiled`, runs a typed three-step queue path (`step_input_prepare` -> `step_policy_evaluate` -> `step_artifact_save`) through the execution ledger, and dispatches tool steps through a registry-backed `ToolExecutionService`
- `POST /v1/plans/compile` now exposes explicit plan-step dependencies plus declared input/output keys so planner output reflects the current multi-step rewrite runtime instead of a thin artifact-save wrapper
- Task contracts can now project a first-class `human_task` branch (`step_human_review`) in plan output by setting `budget_policy_json.human_review_role`, `human_review_priority`, `human_review_sla_minutes`, `human_review_auto_assign_if_unique`, `human_review_desired_output_json`, `human_review_authority_required`, `human_review_why_human`, and `human_review_quality_rubric_json`; rewrite execution now returns `202 awaiting_human` when that compiled review step pauses the queue runtime, creates the linked human task with those routing and review-contract semantics, can auto-preassign a unique exact reviewer when the policy flag is enabled, and downstream artifact persistence can consume `returned_payload_json.final_text` from the completed review packet
- rewrite tool receipts now carry a normalized `tool.v1` invocation contract for the built-in `artifact_repository` handler
- the built-in `connector.dispatch` handler now also runs through `ToolExecutionService` and queues durable delivery outbox rows
- `connector.dispatch` now requires an enabled connector binding that matches the request principal before `/v1/tools/execute` can queue delivery
- observation intake supports `source_id`/`external_id`/`dedupe_key` attribution and auth/raw-payload pointers
- delivery outbox supports idempotency keys plus retry/dead-letter state fields
- `/v1/channels/telegram/ingest` maps raw Telegram updates into normalized observation events
- `/v1/policy/decisions/recent` exposes persisted policy decision audit records
- `/v1/policy/evaluate` exposes direct policy checks for tool/action/channel combinations, including external-send approval branches
- `/v1/policy/approvals/*` exposes pending/history plus approve/deny/expire decision endpoints
- human task packets append `human_task_created`, `human_task_claimed`, and `human_task_returned` events into the linked session ledger so returned-from-human work is auditable
- human task packets can optionally reopen a linked step into `waiting_human`, move the session to `awaiting_human`, and resume that step to completion when the operator returns the packet
- human task queue listings now support operator-facing `role_required`, `assigned_operator_id`, and `overdue_only` filters for targeted reviewer backlogs
- human task payloads now include explicit `assignment_state` values (`unassigned`, `assigned`, `claimed`, `returned`) so pre-assigned pending work is first-class in session and queue projections
- human task payloads now also persist `assignment_source` so manual assignment, route-level recommended assignment, and planner auto-preselection remain distinguishable in session/operator views after later claim and return transitions
- human task payloads now also persist `assigned_at` and `assigned_by_actor_id` so current reviewer ownership includes timestamped actor provenance across manual assignment, claim, and planner auto-preselection paths
- human task list/detail/session rows now also expose compact `last_transition_event_name`, `last_transition_at`, `last_transition_assignment_state`, `last_transition_operator_id`, `last_transition_assignment_source`, and `last_transition_by_actor_id` fields so operators can see the latest ownership change without fetching the full assignment-history chain
- `GET /v1/human/tasks*` and `GET /v1/human/tasks/backlog` now also accept `sort=created_asc` for oldest-created FIFO triage, `sort=priority_desc_created_asc` so urgent and high packets float first while each priority band stays oldest-created-first, `sort=last_transition_desc` for freshest ownership churn, `sort=sla_due_at_asc` for earliest pending SLA, and `sort=sla_due_at_asc_last_transition_desc` to break same-SLA ties by the freshest ownership churn instead of repository/default order
- human task queue views now also accept `priority=<level>` filters so list, backlog, unassigned, and mine views can isolate `urgent`, `high`, `normal`, or `low` work before sorting, and comma-separated values like `priority=urgent,high` pull multiple priority bands in one request
- human task queue views now also accept `assignment_source=<source>` so list, backlog, and mine queues can open the same manual, recommended, or planner `auto_preselected` pending slices exposed by the priority summary endpoint
- `GET /v1/human/tasks/priority-summary` now exposes queue counts by priority band so operators can decide whether to pull `urgent`, `urgent,high`, or the full backlog before opening a reviewer queue
- `GET /v1/human/tasks/priority-summary` also accepts `assigned_operator_id` so assigned reviewer queues can expose their own priority-band load instead of only the global pending backlog
- `GET /v1/human/tasks/priority-summary` also accepts `operator_id` so pre-claim reviewer routing can count only the pending packets that exactly match an operator profile’s role, rubric-derived skill tags, and trust tier before that reviewer opens the backlog
- `GET /v1/human/tasks/priority-summary` also accepts `assignment_source` so routing dashboards can split manual, recommended, and planner `auto_preselected` pending work without fetching the full queue first
- Both SLA-oriented sort modes now fall back to oldest-created ordering for tasks without `sla_due_at`, so unscheduled backlog stays stable even when newer packets are reassigned.
- `GET /v1/human/tasks/{human_task_id}/assignment-history` now filters the linked execution ledger down to ownership transitions so recommended assignment, later manual reassignment, claim, and return provenance remain queryable after the packet state has advanced
- `GET /v1/human/tasks/{human_task_id}/assignment-history` also accepts `event_name`, `assigned_operator_id`, `assigned_by_actor_id`, and `assignment_source` so operator tooling can isolate just recommended, manual, or planner-preselected ownership transitions without scanning the whole chain
- `/v1/rewrite/sessions/{session_id}` now also projects `human_task_assignment_history`, so operator UIs can render the same ownership transition chain inline with session events, steps, and linked human task packets without making a second history fetch
- human task payloads now also compute reviewer routing hints from active operator profiles, rubric-derived skill tags, and trust-tier requirements so the best reviewer candidate can be surfaced directly on each packet
- approving a paused rewrite now resumes execution inline and completes the artifact/ledger flow instead of stopping at a dead intermediate status
- approval-required rewrite requests now return `202 Accepted` with `session_id`, `approval_id`, and `status=awaiting_approval` instead of an error-shaped denial
- rewrite execution now persists durable `execution_queue` rows and drains them inline for API requests before returning
- `app.runner` supports role-based startup (`EA_ROLE=api` or queue-draining worker roles)
- `app.domain.IntentSpecV3` and execution session/event models provide a typed kernel scaffold
- rewrite execution is gated by a centralized policy decision service (`policy_decision` event)

## Hardening Baseline

- app images no longer install `docker.io`
- runtime data/secrets are excluded from version control via a narrowed `.gitignore`

## Storage Backends

- `EA_RUNTIME_MODE=dev|test|prod` controls whether automatic memory fallback is allowed; `prod` fails fast instead
- `EA_STORAGE_BACKEND=postgres` forces Postgres-backed repositories (`DATABASE_URL` required)
- `EA_STORAGE_BACKEND=memory` keeps repositories in-process (dev/test convenience)
- `EA_STORAGE_BACKEND=auto` (default) attempts Postgres first, then falls back to memory in `dev`/`test`
- `EA_LEDGER_BACKEND` is still accepted as a temporary backward-compatible alias, but it is deprecated in favor of `EA_STORAGE_BACKEND`
- `EA_RUNTIME_MODE=prod` requires durable Postgres boot and rejects `memory` or `auto` degradation paths

## Auth

- Set `EA_API_TOKEN=<token>` to require bearer auth on all non-health routes.
- Set `EA_DEFAULT_PRINCIPAL_ID=<principal>` to define the fallback request principal when `X-EA-Principal-ID` is omitted (default `local-user`).
- Principal-scoped connector, human-task, and memory routes treat body/query `principal_id` as compatibility input only; mismatches against the request principal fail with `403 principal_scope_mismatch`.

## Policy Tuning

- `EA_APPROVAL_THRESHOLD_CHARS` sets rewrite input length requiring approval (default `5000`).
- `EA_APPROVAL_TTL_MINUTES` sets default approval request expiration window (default `120`).
- Policy decisions also consider declared tool/action metadata plus task risk and budget classes; disallowed tools fail closed with `policy_denied:tool_not_allowed`.
- `POST /v1/policy/evaluate` can dry-run external-send approval checks over HTTP without going through rewrite artifact creation.
- `POST /v1/human/tasks` accepts `resume_session_on_return=true` to pause a linked step for human review and resume it when `/v1/human/tasks/{human_task_id}/return` is called.

## Quick Start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env values
bash scripts/deploy.sh
bash scripts/db_bootstrap.sh

# or do both in one step
EA_BOOTSTRAP_DB=1 bash scripts/deploy.sh

# quick local memory profile
cp .env.local.example .env
EA_MEMORY_ONLY=1 bash scripts/deploy.sh
# or
make deploy-memory
```

Then open `http://localhost:8090/health`.
