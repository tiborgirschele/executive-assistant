# 🫀 Matrix Vital Scanner (`matrix-health`)

Welcome to the **FUSE Enterprise Matrix**. You have successfully engineered a completely headless, zero-click, VPN-routed, TRaSH-aligned automation pipeline. 

To monitor this architecture without ever needing to open a web browser, the `matrix-health` CLI tool has been permanently forged into your Ubuntu system binaries.

## 🚀 How to Use It

Because it is a global command, you can run it from **anywhere** in your terminal. Simply type:

    matrix-health

## 📡 What It Monitors

The scanner bypasses traditional Docker container status checks and physically interrogates the live REST APIs of your .NET and C++ engines. It provides real-time telemetry across four distinct layers:

### 🛡️ Layer 1: The Kinetic Shield (Gluetun VPN)
* **What it does:** Verifies the tunnel is active and extracts your masked Exit Node IP.
* **What to look for:** `[ACTIVE]` and your masked Exit Node IP.

### ⚙️ Layer 2: The Engine (qBittorrent)
* **What it does:** Proves the C++ daemon is actively listening behind the VPN.
* **What to look for:** `[ONLINE]` and the current qBittorrent version.

### 🧠 Layer 3: The Cores (The Arrs)
* **What it does:** Interrogates the .NET System Health monitors for Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Readarr, and Prowlarr.
* **What to look for:** `FLAWLESS (0 Errors, 0 Warnings)`.

### 👁️ Layer 4: The Neural Link (Overseerr)
* **What it does:** Pings the frontend API to ensure the user interface is online.
* **What to look for:** `[ONLINE] Overseerr is accepting user requests.`
