# LTDs

Consolidated inventory of your lifetime services/products, including product tier/plan, ownership status, redemption deadlines, and local workspace integration posture.

Updated: 2026-03-07

## Workspace Integration Tier Guide

- `Tier 1`: actively wired into the local workspace/runtime and ready for operational use
- `Tier 2`: owned and partially wired, referenced, or intentionally parked in the local workspace
- `Tier 3`: owned and tracked, but no active local workspace integration yet

## Notes

- The Codex session skill list is not the LTD source of truth; skills are local agent capabilities, while this file tracks your external services/accounts.
- Product/deal tier (`License Tier 3`, `Gold Plan`, `Elite`, etc.) is separate from the workspace integration tier used to describe local wiring posture.
- Secrets are intentionally omitted here; only inventory, status, deadlines, and local integration contracts are documented.
