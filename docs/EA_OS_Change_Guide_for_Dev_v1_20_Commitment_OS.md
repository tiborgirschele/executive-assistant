# EA OS Change Guide for Dev v1.20 (Commitment OS Foundations)

## Goal
Bridge the intent-to-execution gap by introducing a persistent execution-session runtime seed.

This slice does not replace existing contracts. It adds auditable session state under the
free-text path so intent compilation, evidence gathering, execution, and reply rendering can
be tracked as deterministic steps.

## What changed

1. New execution-session module:
   - `ea/app/execution/session_store.py`
   - Exposes:
     - `compile_intent_spec(...)`
     - `build_plan_steps(...)`
     - `create_execution_session(...)`
     - `mark_execution_session_running(...)`
     - `mark_execution_step_status(...)`
     - `append_execution_event(...)`
     - `finalize_execution_session(...)`

2. New persistent tables:
   - `execution_sessions`
   - `execution_steps`
   - `execution_events`
   - Added in:
     - `ea/app/db.py` bootstrap path
     - `ea/schema/20260304_v1_20_execution_sessions.sql`

3. Free-text intent runtime wiring:
   - `ea/app/intent_runtime.py` now:
     - compiles `IntentSpec`
     - builds deterministic plan steps
     - creates and runs an execution session
     - records step states for:
       - `compile_intent`
       - `gather_evidence` (when URL scrape is used)
       - `safety_gate` (passive marker for approval-required intents)
       - `execute_intent`
       - `render_reply`
     - finalizes session with `completed` / `failed` outcome

4. Poller callsite alignment:
   - `ea/app/poll_listener.py` passes `tenant_name` into free-text handler for session attribution.

5. Gate coverage:
   - `tests/smoke_v1_20_execution_sessions.py`
   - wired into:
     - `scripts/run_v119_smoke.sh`
     - `scripts/docker_e2e.sh`
     - `.github/workflows/release-gates.yml`
   - plus dedicated runner:
     - `scripts/run_v120_smoke.sh`

## Why this matters

Before this patch, free-text execution was mostly prompt-forwarding with no persistent step ledger.
Now each request gets a durable execution session with auditable lifecycle transitions. This is the
foundation for broader v1.20 planner/session unification across slash commands, skills, and webhook flows.

## Next suggested expansion

1. Reuse execution sessions for typed skill actions and webhook workflows.
2. Add explicit approval-step objects for irreversible actions.
3. Persist per-step budgets, deadlines, and retry policies.
4. Add session replay tooling for operator audit.
