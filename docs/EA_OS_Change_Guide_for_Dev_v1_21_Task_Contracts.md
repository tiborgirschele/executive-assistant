# EA OS Change Guide for Dev v1.21 (Task-First Planner Contracts Seed)

## Goal
Start shifting planning from provider-first routing to task-first contracts without breaking
existing capability routing behavior.

## What changed

1. Added task-contract registry:
   - `ea/app/planner/task_registry.py`
   - Introduces `TaskContract` with:
     - `key`
     - `description`
     - `provider_priority`
     - `output_artifact_type`
     - `approval_default`
     - `budget_policy`
   - Initial contracts seeded for:
     - `travel_rescue`
     - `trip_context_pack`
     - `collect_structured_intake`
     - `guided_intake`
     - `compile_prompt_pack`
     - `polish_human_tone`
     - `generate_multimodal_support_asset`

2. Planner exports updated:
   - `ea/app/planner/__init__.py` now exports task-registry helpers:
     - `task_or_none`
     - `task_or_raise`
     - `list_task_contracts`

3. Capability routing now consumes task contracts:
   - `ea/app/skills/capability_router.py` now:
     - resolves optional `TaskContract`
     - uses task contract `provider_priority` as planning rank seed
     - emits task metadata on plan output:
       - `task_contract_key`
       - `task_contract_approval_default`
       - `task_contract_output_artifact_type`
       - `task_contract_budget_policy`

4. New smoke coverage:
   - `tests/smoke_v1_21_task_contract_registry.py`
   - `tests/smoke_v1_21_intent_spec_v2_shape.py`
   - `tests/smoke_v1_21_provider_broker.py`
   - `tests/smoke_v1_21_generic_skill_execution.py`
   - Validates module presence and task-contract-aware capability planning behavior.
   - Wired into:
      - `scripts/run_v120_smoke.sh`
      - `scripts/run_v119_smoke.sh`
      - `scripts/docker_e2e.sh`
      - `.github/workflows/release-gates.yml`

5. Intent compiler shape expansion (`IntentSpecV2`-style fields):
   - `ea/app/execution/session_store.py` now emits additional fields from `compile_intent_spec(...)`:
     - `deliverable_type`
     - `approval_class`
     - `risk_class`
     - `budget_class`
     - `evidence_requirements`
     - `source_refs`
     - `stakeholders`
     - `output_contract`
     - `commitment_key`

6. Provider broker scoring seed:
   - Added `ea/app/planner/provider_broker.py` with deterministic capability ranking:
     - task-priority weighting
     - preferred capability override
     - lightweight policy adjustment from capability metadata
   - `ea/app/planner/provider_registry.py` adds planner-facing provider contracts
     (`ProviderContract`) and provider lookup helpers (`providers_for_task`, `provider_or_raise`),
     decoupling planner/broker logic from direct `skills` registry imports.
   - `ea/app/skills/capability_router.py` now delegates ranking to broker output and
     emits `ranking` details with reasons.

7. Generic skill execution uplift:
   - `ea/app/skills/generic.py` now supports `runtime_execution_ops` for safe operations.
   - `draft_and_polish` (`polish`), `prompt_compiler` (`compile`), and `multimodal_burst`
     (`generate`) now return deterministic `executed` outcomes with lightweight artifacts.
   - `ea/app/skills/runtime_action_exec.py` now renders `executed` skill outcomes with artifact preview.

8. Task-aware session plan templates:
   - Added `ea/app/planner/plan_builder.py` with deterministic task-aware step construction.
   - `ea/app/execution/session_store.py::build_plan_steps(...)` now delegates to
     `build_task_plan_steps(...)` so free-text, slash-command, callback, and event sessionization
     paths share the same plan-template behavior.
   - Added smoke coverage:
     - `tests/smoke_v1_21_plan_builder.py`
     - `tests/smoke_v1_21_provider_registry.py`
   - v1.21 template behaviors include domain/task-specific enrichment steps:
     - travel: `analyze_trip_commitment`, `compare_travel_options`
     - finance: `verify_payment_context`
     - project: `gather_project_context`
     - health: `review_health_context`
     - gated autonomy: `safety_gate`

9. Runtime syntax safety hardening:
   - Added repository-wide compile smoke: `tests/smoke_python_compile_tree.py`
     and wired it into host/docker/CI gate paths to catch syntax regressions early.
   - Hardened invoice extraction interpolation in `ea/app/poll_listener.py` by
     precomputing nested values (`creditor`, `iban`, `reference`, `amount_value`)
     before caption formatting, reducing quote-fragility in f-string-heavy paths.

10. Proactive planner bootstrap/schema alignment:
   - Added planner/proactive runtime tables to `ea/app/db.py::init_db_sync()`:
     `planner_jobs`, `planner_candidates`, `proactive_items`,
     `proactive_muted_classes`, `send_budgets`, `planner_dedupe_keys`,
     and related indexes.
   - Extended `tests/smoke_v1_18.py` to assert planner table presence in db bootstrap,
     reducing migration/bootstrap drift between planner runtime code and startup schema.

## Why this matters

This keeps provider contracts (`CapabilityContract`) but introduces a stable task layer the
planner can build on next:

- task contracts define planning intent and policy defaults,
- providers become swappable implementations,
- plan outputs carry explicit task metadata for downstream session/approval logic.

## Next expansion

1. Introduce `IntentSpecV2` compilation into task contracts.
2. Add broker scoring (fit/privacy/cost/latency/history) on top of task contract defaults.
3. Persist task-template step metadata (budget/evidence/approval class) in richer execution ledgers.
