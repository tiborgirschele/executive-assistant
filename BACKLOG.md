# EA Execution Backlog

Last updated: 2026-03-05
Branch: `main`

## Definition Of Done (DoD)
- All backlog items are marked `DONE` or `BLOCKED` with reason.
- Latest full gate pass exists from `bash scripts/docker_e2e.sh`.
- Working tree is clean (`git status --short` has no changes).
- Local commits are present (no push required).

## Current Milestone: v1.20 Commitment OS Foundations
- [DONE] Capability registry baseline (`capability_registry.py` + smoke + gates).
- [DONE] Generic skill inventory baseline (`generic.py`, `registry.py`, `skill_inventory` smoke).
- [DONE] Capability planning router (`capability_router.py` + smoke + gates).
- [DONE] Human compose contract tightening and wording alignment.
- [DONE] Doc/code drift guard (`smoke_v1_19_4_doc_alignment.py` + gates).
- [DONE] Generic skill handlers return deterministic capability plan metadata.
- [DONE] Runtime skill-dispatch path:
  - `/skill` command stages typed actions with plan preview.
  - `act:` callback consumes typed actions and routes `skill:*` + payments actions.
- [DONE] Behavioral sidecar/skill orchestration coverage:
  - generic skills now emit deterministic orchestration outcomes (`planned`/`staged`)
    with capability plan metadata.
  - typed skill action rendering now surfaces selected primary/fallback capabilities.
  - `smoke_v1_19_4_sidecar_skill_orchestration.py` added and wired into all gates.
- [DONE] LLM gateway package/export convergence:
  - `app.llm_gateway.client.safe_llm_call` now delegates to
    `app.contracts.llm_gateway.ask_text`.
  - `app.llm_gateway` exports `ask_text` and `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` from the
    hardened contract boundary.
  - `smoke_v1_19_4_llm_gateway_convergence.py` added and wired into all gates.
- [DONE] Briefing diagnostics log hard-gate:
  - internal diagnostics logs are disabled by default and only emitted when
    `EA_BRIEFING_DIAGNOSTICS_LOG_ENABLED=1`.
  - `smoke_v1_19_4_briefing_diagnostics_log_gate.py` added and wired into
    all gates.
- [DONE] Skill planning consistency fixes:
  - `/skill` preview now uses each skill's `planning_task_type`, matching
    runtime dispatch behavior.
  - `trip_context_pack` capability priority is now explicit travel-first.
  - diagnostics log gate smoke now validates runtime behavior (with stubs),
    not only source text.
- [DONE] Auditor LTD inventory:
  - `LTD_INVENTORY.md` added at repo root with product/tier/capability mapping.
  - `smoke_v1_19_4_ltd_inventory_doc.py` added and wired into all gates.

  - `runner.py` now supports `EA_ROLE=event_worker`.
  - compose event-worker now runs via `python -m app.runner` + role env.
  - `roles/event_worker.py` reduced to canonical shim over `workers/event_worker`.
  - `smoke_v1_19_4_event_worker_role_alignment.py` added and wired into all gates.

    (compile/build/render/persist) and deterministic completion/failure outcomes.
  - `smoke_v1_20_brief_command_sessions.py` added and wired into host/docker/CI gates.
- [DONE] High-risk free-text approval gate hardening:
  - free-text intents with `approval_required` autonomy are now blocked behind explicit callback approval.
  - staged typed action `intent:approval_execute` is required before execution can proceed.
  - parent session is finalized as `partial` while awaiting approval, then resumed on approval callback.
  - `smoke_v1_20_free_text_approval_gate_behavior.py` and
    `smoke_v1_20_typed_action_approval_resume.py` added and wired into host/docker/CI gates.

  - added task-aware provider broker seed (`ea/app/planner/provider_broker.py`) and
    routed capability planning through broker ranking output.
  - generic skill handlers now support deterministic `executed` outcomes for safe operations
    via `runtime_execution_ops` with lightweight artifact previews.
  - capability planning now reads task contract provider priority and emits task metadata
    (`task_contract_key`, approval default, artifact type, budget policy), plus broker `ranking`.
  - `compile_intent_spec(...)` now emits an `IntentSpecV2`-style shape with task/approval/risk/output fields
    (`deliverable_type`, `approval_class`, `risk_class`, `budget_class`, `evidence_requirements`,
    `source_refs`, `output_contract`, `commitment_key`).
  - `smoke_v1_21_task_contract_registry.py`, `smoke_v1_21_intent_spec_v2_shape.py`,
    `smoke_v1_21_provider_broker.py`, `smoke_v1_21_generic_skill_execution.py`,
    and `smoke_v1_21_doc_alignment.py`
    added and wired into host/docker/CI gates.

  - added `ea/app/planner/plan_builder.py` with deterministic task-aware plan-step templates.
  - `build_plan_steps(...)` in `ea/app/execution/session_store.py` now delegates to planner templates.
  - added `tests/smoke_v1_21_plan_builder.py` and wired it into host/docker/CI gates.
- [DONE] Planner provider-registry seed (v1.21):
  - added `ea/app/planner/provider_registry.py` with planner-facing `ProviderContract`
    wrappers over capability metadata (`providers_for_task`, `provider_or_raise`,
    `list_provider_contracts`).
  - broker/router now consume planner provider abstractions instead of direct
    capability-registry imports.
  - added `tests/smoke_v1_21_provider_registry.py` and wired it into host/docker/CI gates.
- [DONE] Runtime syntax safety hardening:
  - added `tests/smoke_python_compile_tree.py` and wired it into host/docker/CI gates
    for whole-tree Python parse checks.
  - hardened invoice extraction interpolation in `ea/app/poll_listener.py` by
    precomputing nested values before caption interpolation.
- [DONE] Proactive planner bootstrap/schema drift fix:
  - `ea/app/db.py::init_db_sync()` now bootstraps planner/proactive tables and indexes
    used by `ea/app/planner/proactive.py` (including `send_budgets`,
    `planner_candidates`, `proactive_items`, and `planner_dedupe_keys`).
  - `tests/smoke_v1_18.py` now asserts planner table presence in db bootstrap in
    addition to schema-file contracts.
- [DONE] Event-worker role-path convergence:
  - `EA_ROLE=event_worker` now dispatches through `app.roles.event_worker.run_event_worker`
    from `runner.py` (canonical role shim path), not direct worker import.
- [DONE] Auditor inventory guard strengthening:
  - `smoke_v1_19_4_ltd_inventory_doc.py` now enforces both sections:
    - capability-backed LTD tiers
    - runtime dependencies not tiered as LTD
- [DONE] Auditor LTD inventory hardening:
  - `LTD_INVENTORY.md` now explicitly separates capability-backed LTD tier declarations
    from non-tiered runtime dependencies.
