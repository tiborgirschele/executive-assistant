# EA Execution Backlog

Last updated: 2026-03-04
Branch: `main`

## Definition Of Done (DoD)
- All backlog items are marked `DONE` or `BLOCKED` with reason.
- Latest full gate pass exists from `bash scripts/docker_e2e.sh`.
- Working tree is clean (`git status --short` has no changes).
- Local commits are present (no push required).

## Current Milestone: v1.19.4 Consolidation
- [DONE] Capability registry baseline (`capability_registry.py` + smoke + gates).
- [DONE] Generic skill inventory baseline (`generic.py`, `registry.py`, `skill_inventory` smoke).
- [DONE] Capability planning router (`capability_router.py` + smoke + gates).
- [DONE] Human compose contract tightening and wording alignment.
- [DONE] Doc/code drift guard (`smoke_v1_19_4_doc_alignment.py` + gates).
- [DONE] Generic skill handlers return deterministic capability plan metadata.
- [DONE] Runtime skill-dispatch path:
  - `/skill` command stages typed actions with plan preview.
  - `act:` callback consumes typed actions and routes `skill:*` + payments actions.
- [DONE] Behavioral sidecar/skill orchestration coverage:
  - generic skills now emit deterministic orchestration outcomes (`planned`/`staged`)
    with capability plan metadata.
  - typed skill action rendering now surfaces selected primary/fallback capabilities.
  - `smoke_v1_19_4_sidecar_skill_orchestration.py` added and wired into all gates.
- [DONE] LLM gateway package/export convergence:
  - `app.llm_gateway.client.safe_llm_call` now delegates to
    `app.contracts.llm_gateway.ask_text`.
  - `app.llm_gateway` exports `ask_text` and `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` from the
    hardened contract boundary.
  - `smoke_v1_19_4_llm_gateway_convergence.py` added and wired into all gates.
- [DONE] Full Docker E2E gate pass after each slice.

## Blocked
- None.

## Next Queue (on new feedback)
